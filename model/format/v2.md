# The V2 format

The V2 format was the first attempt at fixing the deficiencies of the V1 format.

This format focuses on improving flexibility in supporting schools which *do not* follow a structure similar to McMaster University.

## Format

Given that the V2 format did have a JSON format and wasn't a well written library (i.e. no tests), it will be described in its JSON format as was done with V1.

Examples will be taken from _The University of Western Ontario_.

### The root

```json
{
  "name": "University of Western Ontario",
  "displays_dep_prefix": false,
  "departments": { ... },
  "section_types": { ... },
  "timetables": { ... },
}
```

|Field|Description|
|-----|-------------|
|`name`| The human readable name for the university.|
|`displays_dep_prefix`| A flag for the front end to indicate wheather or not the UI should prefix course codes with department codes. This is deprecated and course codes are instead now recorded in the scraper with the prefix added if relevant.|

The other keys are complex and defined separately.

#### `departments`

The `departments` key points to a map of department codes to human readable names.

For example:

```json
{
    "CHEM": "Chemistry"
}
```

The values are used as keys for looking up courses for a certain department under `courses`.


### `section_types`

A key-value pair defining section types used by this particular university. The mapping is code to human readable name.

```json
{
  "LAB": "Lab",
  "LEC": "Lecture",
  "TUT": "Tutorial",
  "EXM": "Exam"
}
```

### `timetables`

`timetables` is a mapping of years to terms to a `timetable`. A year can contain one or more terms underneath depending on how course schedules are released.

For example, some schools release a schedule for each semester (those which don't have full-year courses), which would correspond to two timetable records.

The University of Western Ontario releases just a single yearly schedule, so it only has one record. Another record for a summer schedule could be added at a later date if one were to be released.

```json
{
  "2018": {
      "<term>": <timetable>
  }
}
```

### `term`

A term is defined by an enumeration of 17 different possibilities.

|Index|Description|Generally occurs|
|------|-------------|--------------|
|0|Fall first quarter| ~September through mid-October|
|1|Fall second quarter| ~mid-October through December|
|2|Fall semester|~September through December|
|3|Spring first quarter|~January through mid-February|
|4|Spring second quarter|~mid-February through April|
|5|Spring semester|~January through April|
|6|Full school year (Fall and spring semesters)|~September through April|
|7|Summer first semester first quarter|~through May|
|8|Summer first semester second quarter|~through June|
|9|Summer first semester|~May through June|
|10|Summer second semester first quarter|~through July|
|11|Summer second semester second quarter|~through August|
|12|Summer second semester|~July through August|
|13|Full summer|~May through August|
|14|Full year|~January through December|
|15|Not offered|Courses not running this year| 
|16|Unscheduled|Typically web courses|

### `timetable`

A `timetable` represents the courses and their scheduling within a particular year and term. The `last_update` key reflects the last time the data was scrapped from its source.

```json
{
  "courses: { ... },
  "last_update": "2018-11-07T21:07Z"
}
```

### `courses`

`courses` is a mapping of unique course identifiers to their course definition.

```json
{
  "HISTORYHISTORY 2601E6": <course>
}
```

A unique identifier is composed of a courses's department code, course name, and term concatenated together. Course unique identifiers are unique within a timetable. The intention is for this value to be stored when creating saved schedules.

In this particular example, the unique identifier looks strange because it has `HISTORY` twice due to the course name including the department code.

These unique identifiers should only be used for lookup and **not** for display purposes.

### `course`

A `course` has the following format.

```json
{
  "name": "HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA",
  "code": "HISTORY 2601E",
  "credits": 1,
  "department": "HISTORY",
  "term": 6,
  "description": "A study of China beginning with the decline of the Ming dynasty (ca 1600), continuing through the rise and fall of the Qing dynasty, and concluding with the rise of modern China in the late-20th century. Extra Information: 2 lecture hours, 1 tutorial hour.",
  "prerequisites": [<string>, ...],
  "antirequisites": [<string>, ...],
  "notes": [<string>, ...],
  "sections: {...}
}
```

|Field|Description|
|-----|-------------|
|`name`| The name of the course as it appears in the school's documentation.|
|`code`| The code for the course. This may be prefixed with the department code depending on the school.|
|`credits`| The number of credits the course is worth.|
|`department`\*| The code for the department that the course falls under.|
|`term`| The term the course falls under.|
|`description`\*| A description of the course.|
|`prerequisites`\*| Array of unique course identifiers of prerequisites of this course.|
|`antirequisites`\*| Array of unique course identifiers of antirequisites of this course.|
|`notes`\*| Array of any notes associated with this course.|

\* May not be present if the school doesn't support this feature.

### `sections`

`sections` is a mapping of keys from `section_types` to maps of `section`s of that type. The sections are referred to by their code as it appears on the school's course website.

```json
{
   "LEC": {
       "001": <section>,
       "002": <section>
   },
   "TUT": {
       "004": <section>,
       "005": <section>
   }
}
```

### `section`

A `section` has the following format:

```json
{
  "serial": "9852",
  "cancelled": false,
  "online": false,
  "alternating": false,
  "waiting_list": false,
  "num_waiting": <int>,
  "max_waiting": <int>,
  "section_full": false,
  "num_enrolled": <int>,
  "max_enrolled": <int>,
  "r_periods": [<r_period_1>, <r_period_2>, ..., <r_period_n>],
  "s_periods": [<s_period_1>, <s_period_2>, ..., <s_period_n>],
  "notes": [<string>, ...]
}
```

|Field|Description|
|-----|-------------|
|`serial`| The serial number of the section. Some schools use these for course registration.|
|`cancelled`\*| Whether or not the course has been cancelled.|
|`online`\*| Whether or not the course is an online course.|
|`alternating`\*| Whether or not the course alternates (one week on, one week off).|
|`waiting_list`\*| Indicates whether or not the section has a waiting list.|
|`num_waiting`\*| Number of people currently on the waiting list.|
|`max_waiting`\*| Maximum number of people that can be on the waiting list.|
|`section_full`\*| Indicates whether or not the section is full.|
|`num_enrolled`\*| Number of people currently enrolled in the course.|
|`max_enrolled`\*| Maximum number of students that can be enrolled.|
|`notes`\*| Any notes associated with this section.|

 \* May not be present if the school doesn't support this feature.

### `r_period`
 
An `r_period` is a repeating period of time in which a section takes place. Most courses will have these. The format is as follows:
 
```json
 {
   "online": false,
   "campus": <string>,
   "room": <string>,
   "day": 3,
   "start": "16:30",
   "end": "17:20",
   "supervisors": ["Kotsopolous"]
 }
```

|Field|Description|
|-----|-------------|
|`online`\*| Whether or not this period is online (has no physical location).|
|`campus`\*| The campus where this period occurs.|
|`room`\*| The building + room where this period occurs.|
|`day`\*| The day of the week this period occurs (1 (Monday) -> 7 (Sunday).|
|`start`\*| Time string for the start of the period (`hh:mm`).|
|`end`\*| Time string for the end of the period (`hh:mm`).|
|`supervisors`\*| Array of supervisors/instructors for the section (first + last name as one string).|

### `s_period`
 
An `s_period` is a period of time in which a section takes place only once. These are unusual and are only supported by a few schools. Typically, they will denote things like when a test is occurring.

The format is as follows:
 
```json
 {
   "online": false,
   "campus": <string>,
   "room": <string>,
   "start": "2018-06-10T16:30",
   "end": "2018-06-10T17:20",
   "supervisors": ["Kotsopolous"]
 }
```

|Field|Description|
|-----|-------------|
|`online`\*| Whether or not this period is online (has no physical location).|
|`campus`\*| The campus where this period occurs.|
|`room`\*| The building + room where this period occurs.|
|`day`\*| The day of the week this period occurs (1 (Monday) -> 7 (Sunday).|
|`start`\*| Time string for the start of the period (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm`).|
|`end`\*| Time string for the end of the period (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm`).|
|`supervisors`\*| Array of supervisors/instructors for the section (first + last name as one string).|

## Design decisions

The V2 format was designed with the intention of better supporting other universities than the V1 format could.

The main additions were:
- 17 different types of terms that cover most scheduling systems, rather than 3.
- Section types defined per school rather than globally.
- Support for storing more of the other metadata universities typically expose (e.g. notes, enrollment, waiting lists. etc)
- Converted times back into an object rather than an array.

## Deficiencies

The V2 format, while a big improvement over V1, is still lacking in some respects.

### Terms are even more complex than that

While having 17 different term types is much better than 3, there are schools that use still differing scheduling types, such as trimestered. Ideally, terms should be defined per-school rather than globally too. Unfortunately, that's a bit more complex than with sections.

### Still generating the full JSON

The format shouldn't just be a JSON payload that is dropped out of the scrapers to represent the world. It should ideally be a delta that can be applied to a database. It should be the API server's responsibility for generating something similar to the format described.
