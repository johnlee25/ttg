# The V3 format

The V3 format is mostly an augmentation to the V2 format. This format focuses on improving flexibility in the definition of terms and to add metadata to them. Even schools that were compatible with the old term format should benefit from these changes.

It also introduces a fully working diff system for providing timetable update deltas.

## Format

The V3 format implementation uses a data binding model that is technically agnostic to the serialization format. That means that each model entity could be converted to XML, JSON or YAML without much difficulty. For the ease of understanding the format though, JSON will be used in the definition.

### `School`

Information about each school was hardcoded into the frontend, meaning changing anything about the schools required a full code redeployment. This model moves that into something which can instead be represented in a database.

It does not currently have a serialized representation. A serializer would need to be written. However, this is probably what it would look like based on the content of the model:

```json
{
  "id": "western",
  "name": "University of Western Ontario",
  "sectionTypes": {
    "LAB": "Lab",
    "LEC": "Lecture",
    "TUT": "Tutorial",
    "EXM": "Exam"
  },
  "terms": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

|Field|Description|
-----|--------------
|`id`|A universal identifier for the school. This is used as a reference to the `School` in other models.|
|`name`|The human readable name for the `School`.|
|`sectionTypes`|A mapping between valid section type codes and their human readable name. All sections within the timetable must be of one of these types.|
|`terms`|`TermDefinition`s defining the term system used by this `School`.|

### `TimeTable`

```json
{
  "term": "<term_id>",
  "lastUpdate": "2011-12-03T10:15:30Z",
  "courses": {
    <course_unique_id>: <course>,
    ...
  }
}
```

The `TimeTable` model represents a single term as defined by a school. The number of `TimeTable`s per year usually corresponds to how the school releases information. For example, McMaster University releases two timetables: a full year timetable and a summer timetable. Therefore, one full calendar year for McMaster University will have two `TimeTable`s. A database would define a one-to-many relationship between the `School` and `TimeTable` models.

There is no strict requirement for the model to match the school's release schedule. It just makes it easier to accurately create/maintain scrapers.

|Field|Description|
-----|--------------
|`term`|The `Term` this timetable refers to. This is also a model entity. In the `TimeTable` serialization format, this is the code for the `Term`'s `TermDefinition`.|
|`lastUpdate`|When this timetable was last scrapped (stored internally in UTC format).|
|`courses`|All of the `Course`s part of this timetable. `Course`s are referred to in a map by their unique ID.|

### `TermDefinition`

A `TermDefinition` is a meta-model for defining a `Term`. For example, McMaster University might define two "super terms" called `full_year` and `full_summer`.

`TermDefinition`s can themselves contain `TermDefinition`s as "subterms". For example, in the aforementioned `full_year` `TermDefinition`, it would contain two subterms called `fall` and `winter`. Any `TimeTable`, `Course`, `Section` or `*Period` may belong to any `TermDefinition` within the hierarchy with the only requirement being that the hierarchy is maintained.

For example, a `Section` with `Term` of type `full_year` can **only** contain `*Period`s of type `winter` and `fall`. The model implementation will automatically prevent itself from violating this rule.

Like with the `School` model, this model does not have a defined serializer. Content would likely look something like this within that serializer.

```json
{
  "id": "mcmaster"
  ...
  "terms": [
    {
      "code": "full_year",
      "name": "Full Year",
      "yearOffset": 0,
      "subTerms": [
        <term_definition>, // fall
        <term_definition>  // winter
      ]
    }, {
      "code": "full_summer",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

|Field|Description|
-----|--------------
|`code`| The universal code for this `TermDefinition`. In the context of a `TimeTable` model entity, this is used as reference for finding a specific `Term`.|
|`name`|Human readable name.|
|`yearOffset`|This is used specifically when instantiating a `Term`. Subterms of that term may not share the same year as the parent. For example, if the `full_year` is defined for 2018, `fall` would share the same year (2018, `yearOffset = 0`), while `winter` would be 2019 (`yearOffset = 1`).|
|`subTerms`|`TermDefinition`s falling under this one.|

The `TermDefinition` model implementation self validates and will automatically prevent cycles and the same ID being defined more than once anywhere.

In a full system, `TermDefinitions` are ideally defined by hand and **not** scrapped since they are relatively static.

## `Term`

A `Term` is an *instance* of a `TermDefinition`. It anchors the definition to a point in time, which in this case is a year. In addition to defining the layout, it may also contain some metadata about the present term such as the beginning/end dates of the term and exam schedule.

Like with `School`, this also doesn't have a defined serializer. Nevertheless, it would probably look like this:

```json
{
  "code": "fall",
  "year": 2018,
  "key": "2189",
  "dateRange": {
    "startDate": "2018-09-01",
    "endDate": "2018-12-01"
  },
  "examDateRange": {
    "startDate": "2018-12-07",
    "endDate": "2018-12-22"
  }
}
```

|Field|Description|
-----|--------------
|`code`|Reference for the `TermDefinition` from this `School` that the `Term` belongs to.|
|`year`|The year the `Term` refers to.|
|`key`|A contextual variable specifically for scrapers. In this case, this is the form parameter for `2018 FALL` on MOSAIC for McMaster University. It does not have anything to do with the data model.|
|`dateRange`|The course date range for this term.|
|`examDateRange`|The exam period for this term.|

It is assumed that in a full system implementation, new terms with existing `TermDefinition`s would automatically be discovered and created by the scrapers. It would likely be a manual responsibility for adding metadata like date range and exam period though, given that that usually isn't released in a standardized way.


### `Department`

The `Department` is a simple key-value pair defining a department within a school.

The `Department` model is not defined in the serialized format at the moment because it's unclear as to whether that should be a property of the `School` or the `TimeTable`. It would likely make more sense as a component of the `School` given that it's fairly static (with defunct departments retained for historical purposes), but it was not implemented.

While no serialization format is defined, it would likely fall under the `School` serializer as so:

```
{
  "name": "McMaster University",
  ...
  "departments": [
    "CHEM": "Chemistry",
    <code>: <name>,
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

|Field|Description|
-----|--------------
|`code`|The code of the department. Should attempt to correspond to what the school actually uses. This is used as a reference in other model entities.|
|`name`|The human readable name for the department.|

### `Course`

`Course`s are defined within the context of a `TimeTable` and are restricted to only containing entities that fall within the `TimeTable`'s `Term`.

`Course`s have a unique identifier _within the context of a single `TimeTable`_ defined as the concatenation of the department code, course code, and term definition code. This code is for referential purposes and should **not** be used in any UI.

Like with the other sections, `Course`s have no defined serialization format, but would likely look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA",
  "code": "HISTORY 2601E",
  "credits": 1,
  "department": "HISTORY",
  "term": "winter",
  "description": "A study of China beginning with the decline of the Ming dynasty (ca 1600), continuing through the rise and fall of the Qing dynasty, and concluding with the rise of modern China in the late-20th century. Extra Information: 2 lecture hours, 1 tutorial hour.",
  "prerequisites": [<string>, ...],
  "antirequisites": [<string>, ...],
  "corequisites": [<string>, ...],
  "notes": [<string>, ...],
  "sections: {
    <section_type_id>: {
      <section_type>: {
          <section_id>: <section>
          ...
      },
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

|Field|Description|
-----|--------------
|`name`|The name of the course as it appears in the school's documentation.|
|`code`|The code for the course as it appears in the school's documentation. Whether this has the department as a prefix is totally up to the school.|
|`credits`|The number of credits the course is worth.|
|`department`|The code for the department the course is part of.|
|`term`|A `TermDefinition` ID. This can be resolved to a `Term` in the context of a `TimeTable`.|
|`description`|Any description of the course provided by the school's documentation.|
|`prerequisites`|Any prerequisites for this course defined by the unique identifiers for those courses.|
|`antirequisites`|Any antirequesites for this course defined by the unique identifiers for those courses.|
|`corequisites`|Any corequesites for this course defined by the unique identifiers for those courses.|
|`notes`|Any notes appearing with this course in the school's documenation.|
|`sections`|A map of `SectionType`s identified by their ID's as they appear in the `School` definition.|

### `SectionType`

A `SectionType` defines all the sections of a certain type for a  `Course`. In the context of a serialized model, it just functions as a mapping in the representation of `Course`.

```json
{
   "LEC": {
       "001": <section>,
       "002": <section>
   },
   "TUT": {
       "004": <section>,
       "005": <section>
   }
}
```

### `Section`

A `Section` represents the actual components of `Course`s that students register and are assigned to.

As with the other models for v3, no serialized format exists, but it may look like this:


```json
{
  "serialNumber": "9852",
  "groupId": "...",
  "cancelled": false,
  "online": false,
  "hasWaitingList": false,
  "numberWaiting": <int>,
  "maxNumberWaiting": <int>,
  "isFull": false,
  "numberEnrolled": <int>,
  "maxNumberEnrolled": <int>,
  "repeatingPeriods": [<repeating_period_1>, <repeating_period_2>, ..., <repeating_period_n>],
  "oneTimePeriods": [<one_time_period_1>, <one_time_period_2>, ..., <one_time_period_n>],
  "notes": [<string>, ...]
}
```

|Field|Description|
|-----|-------------|
|`serialNumber`| The serial number of the section. Some schools use these for course registration.|
|`groupId`|Additional categorization used by some schools.|
|`cancelled`\*| Whether or not the course has been cancelled.|
|`online`\*| Whether or not the course is an online course.|
|`waitingList`\*| Indicates whether or not the section has a waiting list.|
|`numberWaiting`\*| Number of people currently on the waiting list.|
|`maxNumberWaiting`\*| Maximum number of people that can be on the waiting list.|
|`isFull`\*| Indicates whether or not the section is full.|
|`numberEnrolled`\*| Number of people currently enrolled in the course.|
|`maxNumberEnrolled`\*| Maximum number of students that can be enrolled in the section.|
|`notes`\*| Any notes associated with this section.|

 \* May not be present if the school doesn't support this feature.
 
### `RepeatingPeriod`

A `RepeatingPeriod` represents a period of time within a section that those registered to are expected to end periodically.

The model could be represented in a serialized format as:

```json
{
  "supervisors"
  "notes"
  "campus"
  "room"
  "online"
  "term"
  "activeDates": {
    "startDate": "",
    "endDate": ""
  },
  "times": {
    
  }
}
```
